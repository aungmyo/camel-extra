= Outline view gets a bit better  07nov08 =

Look at the little camels! Still some vagaries going on in this picture - for example the {{{<unnamed>}}} nodes in the picture, caused by the presence of the {{{SimplePattern}}} rule in the grammar that is re-used by a number of patterns. The ordering of the endpoint after the block contents doesn't seem right either - it would be better to see that first (maybe). Also I just noticed I forgot to code in the {{{when}}} clauses! Grr! Don't have time for that now, will have to do it again sometime.

= Recipients and Pipeline =

Easy piece of configuration, pull from the endpoint URL and deliver to a recipient list where each recipient is a pipeline.

This is a choice element, or content-based router, it should be clear what is going on.

= What can I put in a when? =

Here's the completion options visible when attempting to put content into a *when* clause for a choice. Note funcky obsckure error messages. Yes, there is a way to override them, I think.
