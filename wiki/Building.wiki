The Camel Extra project uses [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven] as its build tool. If you don't fancy using Maven you can use your IDE directly or [http://code.google.com/p/camel-extra/downloads/list Download] a distribution.

== Prequisites ==

 * Download and [http://maven.apache.org/start/install.htm install Maven]
 * Get the latest [http://code.google.com/p/camel-extra/source/checkout Source] 

=== A normal build ===

{{{
mvn install
}}}

=== Doing a Quick Build ===

The following avoids running all the unit test cases

{{{
mvn -Dtest=false install
}}}

===  Using an IDE ==

If you prefer to use an IDE then you can auto-generate the IDE's project files using maven plugins. e.g.

{{{
mvn eclipse:eclipse
}}}

or

{{{
mvn idea:idea
}}}


If you have not already done so, you will need to make Eclipse aware of the Maven repository so that it can build everything. In the preferences, go to Java->Build Path->Classpath and define a new Classpath Variable named *M2_REPO* that points to your local Maven repository 

 * on unix its  _~/.m2/repository_ 
 * on windows its  _c:\Documents and Settings\<user>\.m2\repository_
